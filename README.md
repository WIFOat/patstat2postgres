## PATSTAT to Postgres 

> **Warning**
> Work in progress

Postgres import scripts for the [PATSTAT database](https://www.epo.org/searching-for-patents/business/patstat.html).

This repository is based on <https://github.com/altay-oz/load_patstat>.


### how-to

Copy `scripts/config-template.sh` to `scripts/config.sh` and adjust it to your needs.

Run the scripts under `scripts` in the folder `scripts` (meaning the working directory have to be `scripts`)
